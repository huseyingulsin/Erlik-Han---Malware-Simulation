# Malware-Project-of-Visual-Programming-Lecture

## Erlik Han v1

I prepared a simple malware simulation for educational purposes for the Visual Programming(BIL3113) course in the department of Computer Science at Dokuz Eylul University.


It is a simulation program hence it works only in the current directory.

It uses AES Cryptography to encrypt and decrypt files.

#### How are the victim logs(screnshoots,IP Address etc.) sent to the hacker?:

Logs go to the hacker's e-mail via SMTP. You have to specify the credentials in the code.

I am going to add these on v1.1:

 * keyboard logs 
 * webcam logs
